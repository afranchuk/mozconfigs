# win-cross contains:
#
#  * clang: downloaded with mach artifact toolchain --from-build win64-clang
#
# Important details:
#
#  wine needs to be installed, the one bootstrap downloads errors out. I
#  followed https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-wine-on-debian/ for
#  the Debian instructions. Filed bug 1699777 for that.
#
#  ./mach run etc doesn't seem to work. Still debugging. Packaging and moving
#  the executable to the windows drive does work. See also:
#  https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/6701
